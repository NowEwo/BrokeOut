## 📖 About

**BrokeOut** is a modern twist on the classic breakout arcade game, where your mission is simple:

Combining nostalgic gameplay with modern roguelike elements, BrokeOut offers a fresh take on a beloved genre.  
Break bricks, collect power-ups, and watch the chaos unfold through increasingly challenging levels.

> ⚡ Fast-paced, visually appealing, and endlessly replayable — this isn’t your typical breakout game.
>
> (Eeew, currently there's nothing of this, just a menu and a normal breakout game xwx)
